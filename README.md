This is an Android application for solving or creating sudoku puzzles. Time of development: 02/2024

The initial design can be found [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF8TSUDu8k/NKuXcdGKg8zpVAENig9VXg/edit?utm_content=DAF8TSUDu8k&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton).

As a challenge, I will attempt to develop this application within one weekend (or one week, if that does not work out). Start day - Feb 9th
